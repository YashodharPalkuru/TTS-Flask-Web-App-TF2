# TTS-Flask-Web-App

The purpose of this project is to gain platform-independent insights about deep learning and understand the low level details in a complex DL system. As a deep learning beginner, I chose this project as my first non-trivial DL challenge.

For this reason I chose to migrate a Text-to-Speech model written in the old TensorFlow to TensorFlow 2.0. This process provided me with experience of both deep learning research as well as deployment.
